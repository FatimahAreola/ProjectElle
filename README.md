Project Elle’s mission is to help young women take ownership of their health and wellbeing. Consisting of a mobile app and Facebook Messenger Chatbot, Project Elle provides women between the ages of 14 and 25 a resource they can turn to when they are feeling alone. The mobile app links to resources available at Ontario post-secondary institutions for any physical or mental health concerns. The in-app journal feature allows for young women to track their mental health and wellness. An online forum facilitates the creation of strong support networks for women in a transitional period of their lives. Our virtual counsellor is a paid feature that allows for users to speak with a real counsellor over a messaging platform. Finally our in-app and Facebook Messenger enabled chatbot is trained to respond to common concerns and provide recommended next steps, with the added functionality of natural language processing (NLP) to pick up on students appear to be distressed and in need of additional mental health support and recommends appropriate next steps for these students. Overall, Project Elle is meant to be a virtual big sister to young women who need support, Elle can help answer your questions, provide guidance and provide emergency support when you need help the most.

#Inspiration:
Project Elle came from one of our teammate’s experience working as a residence life don for first year students, and our combined experiences as young women moving away from home to pursue post-secondary education. We identified a need for resources that students can turn to when they have health related questions, but would like to maintain confidentiality. We hope Elle can help bridge the gap between the resources that are available for women on our post-secondary campuses, and the support systems encourage them to take ownership of their health.

#How we built it:
Project Elle was built using DialogFlow for the chatbot intents, natural language processing to identify users who may be in distress. Elle is housed on Facebook Messenger and was integrated using Python. It also incorporates Google Cloud Platform features like Google Maps to increase access to location-based resources. Figma was used for our mobile app design.


#Challenges we ran into:
Our team had to pivot Project Elle from her original intent, as a Google home assistant following our market research and initial development. Pivoting our idea and producing a minimum viable project in significantly less time than we had anticipated was a major challenge. Our team had to stay focused, continuously re-evaluate and redefine our requirements and work together to complete the build for Project Elle.


#Accomplishments that we're proud of:
Being able to create a two-fold project that can target a very common issue. Working towards eliminating the stigma surrounding mental health can be a tough challenge - there isn’t a fix-all solution. Societal stigma piles on added pressure to people who suffer from mental health issues, hindering their search for help. Our project aims to reduce self-stigma, enabling a mentality shift to allow people who suffer to deal with their mental health issues without this added pressure. 


#What's next for Project Elle:

Development: Next steps for Project Elle would be to complete the integration of the chatbot into the mobile app, and continue to build a repository of trusted resources to which young women can refer. Enabling our online forum, and leveraging natural language processing to identify and moderate any bullying, harassment or individuals who may be struggling is a significant next step for Project Elle.

Business: Project Elle hopes to expand its scope of services by creating strategic partnerships with existing mental health organizations, counsellors and therapists. A paid-feature within the Project Elle app can connect users with a therapist. Project Elle aims to build its offline community by hosting events and meetups for users who currently connect through its forums.

#Built With: DialogFlow, Facebook for Developers, Python, Figma, Google Cloud Platform

#What we learned:
End to end integration of design and development, how to pivot after an idea doesn’t work out the way you envision it, how to use different tools!
